            <p>Welcome to SuppSnitch! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the SuppSnitch mobile application (the "App") provided by <span class="bold-text">Manimau Studios Pte Ltd</span> ("we," "us," or "our").

            <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
            <p>SuppSnitch is an AI-powered supplement scanner that allows you to take or upload photos of supplement labels. The App uses the Gemini API to analyze the image and provide information such as ingredient lists, potential interactions, possible health hazards, and alternative product recommendations (the "Service"). You acknowledge that this analysis is automated and for <span class="bold-text">informational purposes only</span>.</p>
        </div>

            <p>The App may offer premium features through weekly, yearly, and lifetime subscription plans ("Subscriptions").</p>
            
            <p><span class="bold-text">General Payment Terms:</span> All payments for Subscriptions are processed through Apple's App Store and are subject to the App Store's terms and conditions. We do not directly process or store your payment information.</p>

            <p><span class="bold-text">Auto-Renewing Subscriptions:</span> Weekly and yearly subscriptions are auto-renewing.

Any unused portion of a free trial period will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription.</p>

            <p><span class="bold-text">Lifetime Subscription:</span> A lifetime subscription is a one-time purchase that grants you access to the premium features for as long as the App is available on the Apple App Store.</p>

            <p><span class="bold-text">Refund Policy:</span> All purchases are final and <span class="bold-text">non-refundable</span>. We do not offer refunds or credits for partially used subscription periods. Since all transactions are managed by the Apple App Store, any requests for refunds must be directed to Apple.
